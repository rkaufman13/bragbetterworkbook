- Keep a running document of your brags, both big and small.
- Each time you reach a bragging milestone, stop and do something that makes you feel good. (Maybe it's the same thing each time. Is it a dance, a special dessert, or something else that you love?) 
- With a big win, email those close to you and ask them to help you celebrate. 
- Have a bragging buddy someone who knows how hard this is for you and who can remind you each time you do it well.
- Practice accepting a compliment from someone.
