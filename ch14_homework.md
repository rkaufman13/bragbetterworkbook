- Pick a friend to brag about. Do you have a friend or colleague who needs help having her voice and contributions acknowledged? Is there someone at work who rarely gets the chance to speak up?
- Focus on people whose voices and ideas have been underrepresented and need to be heard.
- Ask someone how you can help promote her. Be sure to ask how they want to be supported, and how they don't want to be supported.
- Brag about a colleague or work contact. Do it in a way that makes them feel good.
