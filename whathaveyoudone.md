##What Have You Done? 
- List your accomplishments over the last year, at least one per month.
- List your top accomplishments over the past five years. Include accomplishments that are outside of work. Are you a board member for a nonprofit? Did you volunteer for a worthy cause? Include anything you did that feels like an achievement.
- List any accomplishments from your previous employers that make you proud. 
- Write about the aspects of your personality that you bring into your work. Are you extroverted? Intuitive?  Funny? How does your personality make you better at what you do?
- List the projects you have worked on in the last year that you are most proud of. What makes you proud of your work? What about those projects did you like, and what skills did these projects allow you to use? 
- What are you best at in your current position? 
- List five regular tasks that you do in your current work that excite you. Get as specific as possible. They don't have to be big tasks, just something you enjoy (for example, I personally enjoy preparing folders for big meetings because it makes me feel organized and in control).
- List what you have learned about yourself and your work in the last year and in the last five years. List any new skills, abilities, certificates, or degrees that you have acquired in the last year or in the last five years.
