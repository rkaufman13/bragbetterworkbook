Now that you've decided you want more visibility, ask yourself the following questions (write down a two- or three-sentence answer for each): 
- What do you want?
- Why do you want it? 
- How do you think you'll get it? 


Pick three people from different parts of your circle (a family member, a close friend, someone you're friendly with, a current coworker, a past coworker, or someone you know only from social media) and ask them the following: 
- What do you think I do? 
- How would you explain my job? 
- What would you tell someone else about my career and work?

Practice bragging to your boss.

Practice bragging to a coworker friend.
