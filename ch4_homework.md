## Make Bragging Regularly a Habit 


So much of Bragging Better is simply being prepared: making yourself think of and prepare for scenarios in which you may have an opportunity to share your thoughts, voice your accomplishments, or speak an unpopular opinion. It's a good idea to think of bragging as a habit, like brushing your teeth, and to do it regularly. Here are a few ideas: 
- Put it in your calendar and brag on a weekly or monthly basis.
- Track your accomplishments and the benchmarks you've reached throughout the year so that you are prepared to share these facts with your boss or manager. 
- Make sure that at least once a month you are including brags in your email communication to your manager and to those you report to. 
- Share your smaller accomplishments on a weekly basis so that those around you can track your continued progress. 
- List examples of where to look for brags in your life so that you are ready to record them when they happen. 
- Consider awards, promotions, or growth of any kind inside the office.
- Brag about accomplishments outside of the office related to your volunteer efforts, sports teams, or community work.

Ready, Set, Go! 
- Craft several brags using the four key elements that make up a brag: gratitude, pride, presentation, and showmanship.
